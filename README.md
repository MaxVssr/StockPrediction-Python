# StockPrediction-Python

```March 18th 2021```

Experimenting with some simple machine learning tasks using the ```mplfinance``` Python library. 
This project was aimed at predicting the value of stocks and providing insight into the stock market.

The concept of machine learning was first introduced to me in a course I was following at school. 
Here I learned some basics to make plots from data that was provided. After I knew some basic ways 
to plot graphs, I started experimenting and doing research online. I found the Yahoo Finance API, 
which I started using, and so this application was created.
